# kssa 0.0.1

* Added a `NEWS.md` file to track changes to the package.

##############################
# Parameters for kssa function:

#data = target time series including real MD

#start.method = method to perform the first imputation of real MD

#segments = Number of segments of same length in which target time series will be split

#iterations = Number of iterations to simulate new missing data

#metric = metric chosen to evaluate the results (rmse, mase, smape etc)

#maximum Missing Data Siz: User controls the maximum MD size for each segment

#############################
#Homework - search for elegant functions that allow us to split time series and put simulation windows inside the segments
