Description: This package runs the Known-Sub-Sequence Algorithm (Benavides et al 2022), which helps to automatically validate and identify the method for missing data imputation in univariate time series. It compares the performance of 12 well known state-of-the-art imputation methods available in packages ‘imputeTS’ and ‘forecast’, and delivers a best method suited for each particular time series.
